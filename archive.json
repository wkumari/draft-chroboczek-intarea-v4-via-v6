Windows has no support for this, neither static configured nor via windows BGP (I opened tickets and waiting for feedback)\n2. There is a EURO-IX working group working to implement it in IX peering LANs: https://github.com/euro-ix/rfc8950-ixp\n3.  Also, there is a Test AS to test your systems at major IX's: https://measurement.network/services/v4less-as/\n5. frrouting has support for it via bgp, support for adding static routes was merged some days before: https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/pull/18654\n6. bird seems to run fine since bird2\n7. Mac OSX seems also not to have support for IPv4 with IPv6 next hop.\n8. VPP works also since a long time\n\n\nAlso, https://blog.bott.im/bgp-unnumbered-in-2025-same-idea-different-implementations/  could be interested especially https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-white-linklocal-capability-06\n\n\n ",

I'm make the excuse that I'm super-jetlagged at the moment :-) \r\n\r\nI'll commit this. please see if you can massage it into something which flows better.
